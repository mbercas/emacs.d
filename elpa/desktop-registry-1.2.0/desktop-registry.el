;;; Commentary:

;; This module provides functions and a global minor mode that lets
;; you track a central registry of desktop files.  This is useful when
;; you use desktop files as project files and want to be able to
;; easily switch between them.

;;; Installation

;; This module is available both on Marmalade and MELPA, so if you
;; have either of those set-up it should be as easy as `M-x
;; install-package RET desktop-registry RET'.

;;; Usage

;; To start using it you need to have a desktop loaded in Emacs, you
;; can then use `desktop-registry-add-current-desktop' to register
;; it.  If you don't have a desktop loaded, you can use
;; `desktop-registry-add-directory' to add a directory containing an
;; Emacs desktop.  It is also possible to use
;; `desktop-registry-auto-register' to have desktops registered
;; automatically upon saving them.

;; After some desktops have been registered you can switch between
;; them by using `desktop-registry-change-desktop'.  This will close
;; the current desktop (without saving) and open the selected one.

;; If it happens that you have accumulated quite a few desktops and
;; you would like to have an overview of them and perform some
;; management tasks, `desktop-registry-list-desktops' will show a list
;; of the registered desktops, along with an indicator if they still
;; exist on the filesystem.

;;; Configuration

;; Apart from the functions to add, remove and rename desktops, and
;; the desktop list, it is also possible to use Emacs' customize
;; interface to change, remove or add desktops in/from/to the registry
;; with the `desktop-registry-registry' user option.

;; There is also the `desktop-registry-list-switch-buffer-function'
;; user option that lets you choose which function to use to show the
;; buffer when calling `desktop-registry-list-desktops'.  By default
;; this is `switch-to-buffer-other-window'.
